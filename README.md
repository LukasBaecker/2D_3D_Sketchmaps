# Comparing 2D and 3D Sketch Maps in Virtual Reality
This repository contains the Unity-project and all important analysis steps from my Masterthesis "Comparing 2D and 3D Sketch Maps in Virtual Reality" written at the [Institute for Geoinformatics](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/)

## Abstract 
The aim of this thesis is to compare 2D and 3D Sketch Maps

## Unity VR-Navigation Project
The [project](../project) subfolder contains the Unity project for a VR navigation task of my study.

This project can be used to be rebuild and used with other environments for VR with head-mounted displays (HMD). The project is ompimized for the [Meta Quest 2](https://www.meta.com/de/quest/products/quest-2/) as a standalone HMD running with Android OS. It includes the model I used in my masterthesis "Comparing 2D and 3D Sketch Maps in Virtual Reality"


### How to set up the Unity Project
Unity Version: 2021.3.10f1

To use the Unity project follow these steps:
  * clone or download the repo
  * open the Unity Hub
  * open the [project](../project) folder and follow the instructions by Unity
  
In the project you will find all assets, skripts and settings I set up for my user study. Following are the most important aspects explained:
  * The assest used, are partly build on my own with Blender and partly downloaded as free assets with CC-licence. The main model can be found in the [/Assets/Masterthesis subfolder](../project/Assets/Masterthesis).

## Analysing Study Results
The subfolder [[analysis]] contains all tools that I needed to analyse the study result as part of my masterthesis.
